## 📊 **How to Use**
Prerequisites
Install PostgreSQL on your machine.
Refer to the official PostgreSQL documentation for installation instructions.
Run the SQL scripts provided in script.sql to set up the database schema and stored procedures:
```bash
psql -U <your_username> -d <your_database> -f script.sql
```
Manually create a user in the users table with the necessary credentials to log in to the application.

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mhasanbash/Mobile-Bank-App.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
    cd Mobile-Bank-App/
   ```

3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the database (PostgreSQL) and apply migrations:  
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Run the Django server:  
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
